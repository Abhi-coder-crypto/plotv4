Prompt for Replit / Developer

Make the following updates and fixes to my existing MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project.
Use this MongoDB connection string strictly in all database operations:

mongodb+srv://raneaniket23_db_user:HGCXB9ffo9oHhK6p@plotcrm.xbtlios.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=PLOTCRM

⚙️ Required Changes

Fix Edit Function in Lead Management Module

The View button is already working properly.

The Edit button currently allows editing but does not save or update the changes in the database.

Fix this so that edited lead details are successfully updated in MongoDB and reflected immediately in the Lead Management UI without needing a page reload.

Remove Page Reload on Module Navigation

Currently, clicking on modules like Dashboard, Lead Management, Settings, etc., triggers a full page reload.

Remove this reload behavior — modules should open instantly or seamlessly using React routing (client-side rendering) without refreshing the browser.

Update Rating Categories

Replace existing rating options (Hot, Warm, Cool) with:

Urgent

High

Low

Ensure that these new labels:

Display correctly in the Lead Management table and forms.

Are saved properly to MongoDB.

Reflect correctly when filtering, adding, or editing leads.

Enhance Project & Plot Modules

Implement logic so that when a salesperson is assigned or receives a lead for a specific project, they can view only the related project details in the Project and Plot section.

The Project and Plot section should dynamically show project details assigned to that user or linked to that lead.

Reference the layout and interaction behavior from https://www.acresland.in/
 for design inspiration and functionality (project display, animation, and layout improvements).

Make sure the new logic integrates cleanly with the current database structure and follows consistent UI design.

✅ Additional Requirements

Maintain consistent styling and responsiveness across all UI updates.

Verify all MongoDB connections use the provided URI.

Test all modules (Lead Management, Project, Plot, Dashboard, Settings) after implementing changes.

Ensure smooth navigation and data flow between modules without page reloads.
