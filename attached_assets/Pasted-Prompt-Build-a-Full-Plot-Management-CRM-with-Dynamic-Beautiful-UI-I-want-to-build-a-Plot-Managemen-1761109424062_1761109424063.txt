Prompt: Build a Full Plot Management CRM with Dynamic Beautiful UI

I want to build a Plot Management CRM web application with a modern, beautiful, and dynamic UI and a MongoDB database.
I’ll provide the MongoDB URI once requested — so make sure the app asks me for it while setup.

💡 Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js (Next.js optional), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for animations), ShadCN/UI for clean components.

Backend: Node.js, Express.js.

Database: MongoDB (cloud or local, I’ll provide URI).

Auth: JWT-based Authentication.

State Management: Redux Toolkit or Context API.

Design System: Responsive, minimal yet professional; blue–gold color theme with glassmorphism touches.
